katpoint
========

Coordinate library for the MeerKAT project, providing astronomical coordinate
transformations, antenna pointing models, correlator delay models, source flux
models and basic source catalogues, using an existing coordinate library such
as PyEphem to do the low-level calculations.

> [!CAUTION]
> This version of the package (referred to as **katpoint 0**) is no
> longer under active development but will still receive bug fixes.
> It is superceded by **katpoint 1**, which is hosted by SKAO in a
> [separate repository](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/katpoint).
